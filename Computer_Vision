robotics field's important thing is to help people with their needed skills
such as a person more than aged 65 years, disabled person, etc. 

technology of robotics field are Computer Vision, Natural language processing, Edge computing, Complex event process, HW acceleration, Reinforcement Learning, GANs, etc. 

## Computer Vision
Computer Vision means that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other inputs. 
Other inputs except images, video can be exampled as MRI, FFT, Motor, Frequencies, Audio Signals, RF, Voltage/Current, Electromagnetic wave, Analog signal, Digital Signal, Energy and Power, etc. 

### RF signals 
RF is Radio Frequency that is the oscilation rate of an alternating electric current or voltage or of a magnetic, electric or electromagnetic field or mechanical system in the frequency range from around 20 kHz to around 300GHz. This is roughly between the upper limit of audio and lower limit of infrared frequencies. 

RF signal usually used for Cordless and Cellphones, radio and television broadcast stations, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, satellite communications systems. 

In addition, 
other appliances outside of communications, including microwave ovens and garage door openers. Some wireless devices like TV remote controls, computer keyboards, computer mice, operate at IR frequencies which have shorter electromagnetic wavelengths. 

### Electromagnetic Field signals
Electromagnetic Field signals can be derived from whenever electric charges are accelerated. This make it possible to produce electromagnetic waves by letting an alternating current flow through a wire, an antenna. The frequency of the waves created in this way equals the frequency of the alternating current. 

Magnet is a material or object that produces a magnetic field. 
An electromagnet is made by winding an insulated copper wire around a soft iron core either in the shape of a solenoid or U-shape and passing current through it. 
(iron, steel, nickel, cobalt, etc)

The strength of magnetic field of an electromagnet depends on 
     1. The number of turns of wire wound around the coil.
     2. The amount of current flowing through the wire. 

### Sensors
There are sensors such as proximity sensor, thermometer, accelerator, pressure sensor, optics, gyroscope, position sensor, ultrasonic transducer, Thermocouple, photoelectric sensor, photodetector, hygrometer, light, hall effect sensor, infrared, motion detector, capacitive sensing, microelectromechanical, touch switch, thermistor, passive infrared sensor, pressure, 
ultrasound, temperature sensors, etc. 

Proximity sensor is a sensor able to to detect the presense of nearby objects without any physical contact. A proximity sensor often emits an electromagnetic field or a beam of electromagnetic radiation (infrared, for instance), and looks for changes in the field or return signal. 

Thermometer(infrared sensor) can detect other infrared signal from human so it revealed as temperature of body. 

An ultrasonic sensor is an instrument that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves. An ultrasonic sensor uses a transducer to send and receive ultrasonic pulses that relay back information about an object's proximity.


An active ultrasonic motion detector emits ultrasonic sound waves that reflect off objects and bounce back to the original emission point. When a moving object disrupts the waves, the sensor triggers and completes the desired action, whether this is switching on a light or sounding an alarm. higher than acoustic (human hearing signal) and higher than infrasound (which is lower than acoustic) acoustic 20~20kHz.

Principal of infrared sensor/ultrasonic sensor
IR transmitter(lightening) is a light emitting diode(LED) which emits infrared radiations. 
When operated at a supply of 5V, the IR transmitter consumes about 3 to 5 mA of current. Infrared transmitters can be modulated to produce a particular frequency of infrared light. 

IR Receiver 
are also called as infrared sensors as they detect the radiation from an IR transmitter. 

robotics field need several sensors like camera, lidar, radar, Xavier, Ram, SSD
SSD for storing memory of camera, SSD;s capacity needed as a day needed 필요량, 
one frame (1920 X 1080) of a video can be took more than 0.5 sec and for a 7 hour it needs at least 50400 frames for a day. 
one frame of a video can consume more than 60 kbyte as storage. 



as a personal robots for helping elders for one person as business to showering themselves with robotics' arms need to support other persons' body's weights at least 40kg to 110kg 
it can be use in fattest person showering. 
also it can reduce the 욕창 who always lay down on the bed so cannot move by themselves so it resulted to generate any pains on their backs. 

also 
trying to guess their minds to make them comfortable as feeling when they using their robots. 

like roborock company which has vacuum wireless robots for cleaning their living room or any rooms in residences. 

first of all creating any code for setting a robots. 

making hardware of robots as a humanoid or make any appliance of kitchen to sell. as a start business.

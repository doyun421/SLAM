Humanoid Robot Industry


      Data Scientist : Data Modeling with Statistics and Mathmetics for predicting the future data. 
                       Choosing proper Data Model and Proper Pytorch or Tensorflow or Nxins or other Library for taking proper Data handling tools such as pandas, numpy, image decoder, image encoder as python
                       But it needs to check the ROS2 program for checking lidar sensor data and handling these data as input value for data analysis. 
                       AI for robotics service can be choosen with baby care or others. 
                       competition for robotics company
                       accuracy competition as robotics field. 
                       high accuracy should have to be dependent on only the number of data?
                       fast and accuracy was the point 
                      
                       accuracy should have be the number of percentage of the test bed. 
                       not a train bed. 


                        data for image for robotics 
                        and the data for numbers as lidar counts. 
                        ultra sound frequency data as sound for detecting the noise of voice or environment sounds. 

                        for detecting the thermal of human or other data

                                          so it needs what is the domain it is not a data itself.



                        Data examples as robotics 
                                                       : lidar, raser, radar, mic, rf signal for communicating with other devices such as phone for remote controlling, 
                                                         camera for visioning, 

                        Image Data from camera when they only using delivery robot is they have same specity as load or restaurant or residential apaprtment building 
                                                                                    and also korea has buildings which are crowded. 
                                                                                    but the building have similar look so it's hard to distinguish
                                                                                    so same but similar very it require qutie sophisticated process. 
                                                                                    it needs detail process modelling. 
                        
                                                                                    not a 1st order function but those like 4th order function for the detail but it could take more than 2 sec for each images. 
                                                                                    so it's really hard to processing for real business. 
                                                                                    so it's the purpose to find proper model against each domain industry.

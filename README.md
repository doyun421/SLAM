    what is a feature?
In machine learning, features refer to the measurable and quantifiable properties or characteristics of an object, person, or phenomenon.

    = made 의 high quality version]
    
    sufficient

    to a higher degree than is usual or average.

    
    differentation between stereo camera and RGB-D camera
    stereo camera :  is a type of camera with two or more lenses with a separate image sensor or film frame for each lens. 
    RGB-D camera :  a type of depth camera that provides both depth (D) and color (RGB) data as the output in real-time.

    
    why pure used
    not mixed or adulterated with any other substance or material.

"it was raining heavily"

    parallelized 
    adapt (a program) for running on a parallel processing system.
"special software parallelizes C-based programs"

    threads

A thread is a separate flow of execution. This means that your program will have two things happening at once. But for most Python 3 implementations the different threads do not actually execute at the same time: they merely appear to.

    accommodate
    fit in with the wishes or needs of.
"any language must accommodate new concepts"

    different rates
    keyframes
    A keyframe, also written as “key frame,” is something that defines the starting and/or ending point of any smooth transition. That something can be a drawing in animation or a particular frame of a shot when dealing with film or video

    module why they call this module  computer hardware, a module is a component that is designed for easy replacement. In computer software, a module is an extension to a main program dedicated to a specific function. In programming, a module is a section of code that is added in as a whole or is designed for easy reusability.

    꼼꼼하게 하고 싶음 완벽하게 다 소화하고 싶음. 
    어떤 논문이든 다 설명할 수 있는 수준으로 빠르게 말하면 됨 

    그냥 다 정리하고 난 다음에 뭐든 할 수 있을 듯
    속도를 높이고 싶음
    


정말 최대로 모두 정리하고 
밥은 심각하고 주거도 심각하다
명절을 날 자격이 없다
내일 아침에 1시에는 꼭 집에
가서 마저 정리하길

이마트 가는 길에 
두 달치 식량? 
사실 과자보다 
죽이 더욱 효용이 높다

식량 확보가 중요한 거 같다..
그리고 과일 최대한 많이 먹자
소화가 안되는 거 보니 과일이 답이었다

요리 너무 싫고
밥도 싫었는데

반찬도 싫고 
어찌할 지 모르겠다

식단 정말 짜기 싫다
그냥 구내 식당 가고 싶다

점심은 구내 식당 가고 
아침 저녁은 
차돌이 효과가 좋다 

김치랑 차돌 



삼합 죽 * 10개,
삼계 전복 죽 * 5개
김치찌개 구입이 나은 듯 
직접 해먹기 힘드니까..


10/1 일
아침 8시 멜론 + 닭도리탕
점심 1시 사과 + 잔치국수
저녁 6시 샤인 + 밥과 차돌김치찌개

밥은 콩 비율 줄이기
야채 골고루 
부추전 + 고기
애호박전 + 고기
당근전 + 고기

밥은 최대한 밖에서 사먹자
만들면 모든 시간 다 날라감..
닭가슴살 놓고 만들어 먹기..

왜 두배지..

식사는 최대한 간단히 하기..


구디에서 11월에 엄마집으로 오기..
6주 후..
집에 와서 생활
그리고 
회사는.. 제발 다음 주 다다음 주 결정 되길..


식단이 정비 되어 있어야 안정감을 찾는다.

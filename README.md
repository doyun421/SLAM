    what is a feature?
In machine learning, features refer to the measurable and quantifiable properties or characteristics of an object, person, or phenomenon.


    established
    having been in existence for a long time 
    = made 의 high quality version]
    
    sufficient
    enough; adequate.

    particularly why used
    to a higher degree than is usual or average.

    
    differentation between stereo camera and RGB-D camera
    stereo camera :  is a type of camera with two or more lenses with a separate image sensor or film frame for each lens. 
    RGB-D camera :  a type of depth camera that provides both depth (D) and color (RGB) data as the output in real-time.

    
    why pure used
    not mixed or adulterated with any other substance or material.

    module why they call this module  computer hardware, a module is a component that is designed for easy replacement. In computer software, a module is an extension to a main program dedicated to a specific function. In programming, a module is a section of code that is added in as a whole or is designed for easy reusability.

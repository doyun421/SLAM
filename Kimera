extremely realization and usages in real life. 

## Robotics Older ages Care 
Goal is associate whole olders persons in Korea contained my parents and grand parents.

1. How to get patent for safety of tech.
The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) defines a patent for an invention as “the grant of a property right to the inventor.”

incorrect inter and intra-robot loop closures
robot asso can returned to be incorrect in loop closures so cannot find their locations for helping elders. 

The problem of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping(SLAM) suffers from drift in long run odometry and the only way to correct that is by graph optimization based on loop closure detection, where a robot is able to correct its location precisely if it detects that it is at a place which was visited before
It is used in robotics by some legged or wheeled robots to estimate their position relative to a starting location.

Visual odometry (VO) is a common solution for obtaining robust and consistent relative motion estimates of the vehicle frame. Contrarily, Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements are typically used for absolute positioning and localization.

### Visual Odometry with Loop Closure Detection 
### Loop Closure Detection
      

inertial odometry needs to weight balls (추) to let them go where they was in
so it can measure the speed and time how time consume if they move from first site to other site and come back
inertial can tell us the measurements as cm/s, sec, else.

Graph as sLAM technic is to positioning the a robots' position as image data 
pixels' turns. 

3D generator can be defined from depth camera 
with depth informations 

RGB camera 

depth means infrared vims for measuring the distance between objects and the laser point origin
metric semantic understanding means a naming all objects in the picture as detected. 

visual inertial SLAM means 
mesh program for creating mesh points as graphic with picture datas.



Feature extraction from camera rgb data can reveal tracking mapping results

portfolio as practice all models with valuing or changing some parameters and get vest accuracy. 
and have a 주관 in which model should be used as other conditions or other problems in society. 
or in business.

### Patent

Step 1. IP intellectual property protection I need
IP: to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce.
patents, copyrights(an assignee to print, publish, perform, film, or record literary, artistic, or musical material), trademarks( any word, phrase, symbol, design, or a combination of these things that identifies your goods or services), and trade secrets.
